The authors of this paper discuss the minimum amount of nodes with which a network can be dismantled just by removing these "structural nodes." This type of work on the robustness of a network has applications in immunization or disease spreading models where we want to dismantle a network and split up groups of people in the network and also in different types of opinion models. For the purpose of this experiment, the authors used a multiplex network model with nodes which are arranged in layers. They analyzed this model and compared it to single layer network models as well by applying different algorithms to each model and determining when the networks broke apart. This paper mainly explains how structural nodes have the power to break apart a network and compares how many structural nodes are present in various situations. The authors compare their results to the results of real world multiplex networks to validate the work of their model. They found that multiplex networks have smaller sets of structural nodes as compared to single layer models, and therefore, concluded that there would be significant inaccuracies about the predicted robustness of a system if its multiplex nature is ignored.
