1) What is the application domain?  What is the system of interest?
The application domain is economics and health. The goal is to explore the role economic segregation can have on creating income differences in healthy eating.

2) What is the primary experimental question the authors address?
The primary experimental question the authors address is what role economic segregation has in creating income differences
in healthy eating and what policy levers may be appropriate for countering income disparities in diet.

3) What kind of model do they use?
They use an agent based model.

4) What methods do they apply to the model?   Analysis?  Simulation?

5) What work does the model do?  Predict?  Explain?  Design?

6) What validation do the authors report?
The authors discuss how their model fits in with observational studies and survey data from government and industry sources. However,
the authors also state that the model was not meant to be highly realistic and that they were happy with the ways in which it fit in with
qualitative patterns that had been observed in the past.

7) Are the conclusions supported by the results?
