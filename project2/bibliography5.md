In this paper, Macy and Willer investigate whether human social interactions can be accurately modeled with agent based models. Their system of interest is human sociology and social interactions. They want to determine whether human groups display the characteristics of an agent based model: highly complex, nonlinear, path-dependent, and self-organizing. They use an agent based model to explore human groups and socialization. They apply analysis to their simulation and discuss reasons why a useful model for human social groups can be made using agent based modeling. The model explains the usefulness of agent based modeling and discusses how it can be done in such a way as to make sense of the world without adding too many dimensions to models or failing to add important factors to these models. The authors discuss the importance of validating models, and they compare the social patterns they see in their model to the results from other models. The conclusion that agent based models can be a useful tool for sociologists to bridge the gap between the micro and macro levels of interaction do seem to be supported by the results of their analysis and experimentation.
